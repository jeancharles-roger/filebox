= M1 (no date yet) =

 * Uses of an OSGI Architecture (*done*),
 * Basic UI using SWT (*under development*),
 * Preferences save (*done*),
 * Services discovery over a local network (with zeroconfig network) (*under development*),
 * Simple network operations (including file transfer) through RMI (*under development*).

= M1 updated =

New guide lines has been defined for *Filebox*. It has to be more simple. 
OSGI, RMI and other complex stuff create tones of code lines for no good reason. 
It has been decided to stop this and returns to the use of library that has been thought for easy use.
