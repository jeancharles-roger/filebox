= Globals =
The aim of the services in filebox is to allow the extensions to access to objects that can be extended. To do so, we will provide a class named *Globals* that shares these objects.

Sample:

MenuManager menuBar = Globals.get("menuBar",MenuManager.class);

We can specialize Globals with for instance FileboxGlobals with some application's specific methods.

MenuManager menuBar = FileboxGlobals.getMenuBar();
